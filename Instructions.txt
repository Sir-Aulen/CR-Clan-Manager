Note: this program requires the use of Chromedriver, which can be installed from http://chromedriver.chromium.org/

Setup:
1) After downloading the .zip file from github, extract the contents to a folder of your choosing.
2) Download Chromedriver (link above), and extract the file.
3) Move Chromedriver to the CR clan manager folder
4) Run CR-Clan-Manager

Other note: When inputting your clan tag, the "#" shown before it in Clash Royale is unnecesary.
-You can find your clan tag by opening Clash Royale, navigating to your clans page, and looking directly above the red "leave" button.

Thanks for using CR Clan Manager! Any questions/comments/bugs, message my discord server at https://discord.gg/hDFMTUg
